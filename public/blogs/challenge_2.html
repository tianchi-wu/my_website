<h1>Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing</h1>
<p>Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following</p>

<p>We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.</p>

<p>Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What’s happening?</p>
<p>However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.</p>
<p><img src="F:/Learning/London Business School/Courses/Applied Statistics/my_website/images/tfl_monthly.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.</p>
<p><img src="F:/Learning/London Business School/Courses/Applied Statistics/my_website/images/tfl_weekly.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation <code>excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals</code>.</p>
<p>Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?</p>

<p>As usual, there is a lot of explanatory text, comments, etc. You do not need these, so delete them and produce a stand-alone document that you could share with someone. Knit the edited and completed R Markdown file as an HTML document (use the “Knit” button at the top of the script editor window) and upload it to Canvas.</p>

<h1>Rubric</h1>
<p>Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn’t complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn’t use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed.</p>
<p>Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output).</p>
<p>Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you’ve written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.</p>
