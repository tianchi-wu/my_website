```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```


We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```


```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change_code}

#first we need to filter our database to have only years >= 2015
bike_filtered <-
bike %>% filter(year >= 2015)

#summarizing per month - we don't need the week value, only monthly
bike_filtered <-
bike_filtered %>%
group_by(year,month) %>%
summarize(bikes_hired = mean(bikes_hired))

#now we will calculate the monthly average throughout the years and save it in a new column
bike_filtered <-
bike_filtered %>%
group_by(month) %>%
mutate(average_hire = mean(bikes_hired)) %>%
ungroup()

#calculate the change from monthly average
bike_filtered <-
bike_filtered %>%
mutate(change_monthlyavg = bikes_hired - average_hire)

#create basic line graph of average hire (blue) and bikes hired per month (grey) faceted by year
p <- ggplot(data = bike_filtered, aes(x = month)) +
geom_line(aes(y = average_hire, group = 1), color = "blue") +
geom_line(aes(y = bikes_hired, group = 1), color = "grey") +
facet_wrap(~year) +
#adding shadded area between both lines
geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = bike_filtered$average_hire , ymax = bike_filtered$bikes_hired), alpha = .5, group =1)

p
```

```{r tfl_percentage_weekly_change_code}

##first we need to filter our database to have only years >= 2015
bike_filtered <-

bike_filtered<-
bike_filtered %>%
mutate(weekly_change_per = (bikes_hired - weekly_average)/weekly_average)%>%
 
#make a new column "tag" to colorize shapes depending on whether change is above or below expected level
  mutate(tags = ifelse(weekly_change_per>=0, "Above", "Below")) %>% 

#make a new column "week_shade" to colorize the background.
  mutate(week_shade = if_else(week <=13|week>=26&week<=39,"white","grey"))



```

```{r}
