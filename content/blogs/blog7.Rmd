# GDP components over time and among countries

Firstly we used United Nation's database to load our data.


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

Then we tidy the data to pivot longer and also save lists for filter later.

```{r reshape_GDP_data}

#save lists for filter later 
components <- c("Gross capital formation", "Exports of goods and services", 	
"General government final consumption expenditure", "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)", "Imports of goods and services","Gross Domestic Product (GDP)")

#clean data
tidy_GDP_data  <-  UN_GDP_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = (4:51), names_to = "Year", values_to = "Sum") %>% 
  mutate("Sum" = Sum/1e9) %>% 
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year))

data_renamed<- tidy_GDP_data%>%
 filter(IndicatorName %in% components) %>%   
pivot_wider(names_from = IndicatorName,values_from = Sum)
  

names(data_renamed)[4:9] <- c("HCE","GGFCE","GCF","EGS","IGS","GDP") 


glimpse(data_renamed)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
```

Firstly we want see how does each component of GDP grows over time.


```{r, produce_the_plot, out.width="100%"}

components <- c("Gross capital formation", "Exports of goods and services", 	
"General government final consumption expenditure", "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)", "Imports of goods and services")

components2 <- c("Gross capital formation", "Exports", 	
"Government expenditure", "Household expenditure", "Imports")

three_GDP <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>%
  filter(IndicatorName %in% components) 


gdp1 <- ggplot(data = three_GDP, aes(x = Year, y = Sum, group = IndicatorName, color = IndicatorName)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.8)+
  facet_wrap(~Country)+
  scale_color_manual( values=c("#F8766D", "#A3A500", "#2FCB95", "#00B0F6", "#E76BF3"),
                      name="Components of GDP",
                       labels= components2)+
  labs(x = "", y = "Billion US$", title = "GDP components over time", subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD")+
  theme(legend.position = "right")+
  theme_bw()+
  coord_equal(ratio = 0.008)

gdp1
```
Secondly, 
recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). We'll calculate GDP using the components given above.

```{r, calculate_gdp,out.width="100%"}

components3 <- c("Gross capital formation", "Exports of goods and services", 	
"General government final consumption expenditure", "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)", "Imports of goods and services", "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)")

three_GDP <- data_renamed %>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list)

three_GDP_1<- three_GDP %>% 
  mutate("Net_export" = EGS - IGS ) 

three_GDP_2 <- three_GDP_1 %>% 
  mutate("GDP_calculated" = HCE + GGFCE + GCF + Net_export)
three_GDP_3 <- three_GDP_2 %>% 
  mutate("GDP_difference_per" = (GDP - GDP_calculated) / GDP)

gdp_difference <- ggplot(data = three_GDP_3, aes(x = Year, y = GDP_difference_per)) + 
  geom_line(color = "#00B0F6", size = 0.8)+
  facet_wrap(~Country)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1),limits = c(-0.08,0.07))+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(y = "", title = "Difference between GDP and calculated GDP")


```


We want to produce another plot to see changes of proportion of each component of GDP.


```{r gdp_breakdown, out.width="100%"}

components4 <- c("Government Expenditure", "Gross capital formation", "Household Expenditure", "Net Exports")
three_GDP_4 <- three_GDP_3 %>% 
  mutate("GGFCE_per" = (GGFCE) / GDP) %>% 
  mutate("GCF_per" = (GCF) / GDP) %>% 
  mutate("HCE_per" = (HCE) / GDP) %>% 
  mutate("Net_export_per" = (Net_export) / GDP) %>% 
  select(Country, Year, GGFCE_per,GCF_per,HCE_per,Net_export_per)

three_GDP_5 <- three_GDP_4 %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = (3:6), names_to = "Components", values_to = "Proportion" ) 

gdp2 <- ggplot(data = three_GDP_5, aes(x = Year, y = Proportion, group = Components, color = Components)) +
  geom_line(size = 1)+
  facet_wrap(~Country)+
  scale_color_manual( values=c("#F8766D", "#A3A500", "#2FCB95", "#E76BF3"),
                      name="",
                       labels= components4)+
  labs(x = "", y = "proportion", title = "GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars", caption = "Source: United Nations, https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads")+
  theme(legend.position = "right")+
  theme_bw()+
  coord_equal(ratio = 80)

gdp2
```

#My conclusion
Emerging countries like India is going through an increase in gross capital formation since lots of infrastructure and real estates have been invested, as well as a decrease in household expenditure because India takes lower priority of household expenditure in boosting economy.

Developped countries have a relatively stable trend in those four components, except countries that have solid industrial foundation like Germany is going through an slight increase in net exports.
